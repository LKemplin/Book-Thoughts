# Solo_Project_Book_Thoughts

This is my final project I did for my full stack developer certification.

Book Thoughts was created with full stack JavaScript using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

The website has full CRUD operations and allows users to add their book review (aka Book Thoughts) to the database that displays on the main page.

I'm currently working on adding user authorization features like login and registration, so please check out the "loginandreg" branch to see my progress.
